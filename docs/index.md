# Home

My dotfiles manage everything from NixOS configurations and automation with Ansible to infrastructure setup using Terraform. They also include setups for Proxmox and networking to maintain a streamlined and efficient homelab environment. It's all about keeping things organized and automated, ensuring my systems are easy to manage and deploy
